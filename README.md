Weekly invitations for The Business Interchange
As a member of The Business Interchange (TBI), I was asked if I would send out the meeting invitations.
Members had a mixture of email and messaging and some received their invitations on laptops and others on desk machines or tab lets or mobile phones.
The task was to find a way of having a 'one size fits all' solution.
I designed a mobile first fully responsive invitation and inserted the code into the html code section of a Google emial. This allowed most members to recieve their mail. The exception was those members who prefered to get a text message and for this, I have a simple solution. As all members are now in a WhatsApp group is very simple to contact them all and send  them an invitation.

Show the file on live server and select Inspect and then capture full size screen shot from the menu and save the image and paste it into WhatsApp.
